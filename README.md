# About

In this project, I have created AI Virtual Assistant so that by voice recognition, the machine will respond to us and will also perform the task. I have done this project on the concept of Personal Voice Assistant, also I have used Speech Recognition. For Real World Example :- Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa, & Apple's Siri .

# Virtual Assistant OR Voice Assistant

Virtual assistant or Voice Assistant is an awesome thing. If you want your machine to run on your command like Jarvis did for Tony. Yes it is possible. It is possible using Python. Python offers a good major library so that we can use it for making a virtual assistant. Windows has Sapi5 and Linux has Espeak which can help us in having the voice from our machine. It is a weak A.I. 

Virtual Assistant also known as voice recognition, personal voice assistant, Jarvis, etc. But all the working progresses are same.

# Test Example

This is a testing example takes by me. In this example you can see, the user give to task or ask question to the machine, then machine perform the task and get the result to the user. Now see:-
